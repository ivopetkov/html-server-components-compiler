# HTML Server Components compiler (in PHP)

**A brand new way to build websites**

It's a simple idea:

Instead of using template engines or PHP includes in your HTML code use the &lt;component&gt; tag. It allows you to:
- Include code from other files (`<component src="file:header.php"/>`).
- Pass arguments (`<component src="file:content.php" pageID="home"/>`) that are available in the file (`$component->getAttribute('pageID')` or just `$component->pageID`).
- Automatically places the included file HTML code into the proper places (Tags in the `head` go in the parent document `head`).
- Makes easy to test each component because each component outputs full HTML code.
